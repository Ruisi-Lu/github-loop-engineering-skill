# GitHub MCP tool map

Use this reference with the official [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server). Tool names and schemas can evolve, and MCP hosts can add a namespace prefix. Inspect the connected schema before calling a tool; the live schema wins over these examples.

## Required toolsets and access

The official server's default set includes issue tools but can omit project tools. Enable the relevant toolsets for the workflow:

| Toolset | Use |
|:--|:--|
| `context` | Resolve the authenticated GitHub identity |
| `repos` | Read repository instructions and templates |
| `issues` | Read/write issues, comments, types, and sub-issues |
| `labels` | List or maintain repository labels |
| `projects` | Discover Projects, add items, and update fields |
| `pull_requests` | Read or update PR linkage and completion context |

Project reads require project-read access; project writes require project-write access. Issue and repository operations require access to the target repository. A server configured in read-only mode will not expose write tools even when a write toolset is requested.

If a needed tool is absent, tell the user which toolset or write capability is missing. Stay MCP-only.

## Canonical operations

| Goal | Tool | Method or important input |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Identify current user | `get_me` | no input |
| Read an issue | `issue_read` | `get` |
| Read comments | `issue_read` | `get_comments` |
| Read hierarchy | `issue_read` | `get_sub_issues` or `get_parent` |
| Read issue labels | `issue_read` | `get_labels` |
| Create/update/close issue | `issue_write` | `create` or `update` |
| Add a timeline note | `add_issue_comment` | body and issue number |
| Search for duplicates | `search_issues` | GitHub issue search query |
| List issue types | `list_issue_types` | owner and optional repo |
| List custom issue fields | `list_issue_fields` | owner and optional repo |
| Attach/reorder a sub-issue | `sub_issue_write` | `add`, `remove`, or `reprioritize` |
| List labels | `list_label` | owner and repo |
| Create/update/delete label | `label_write` | explicit `method` |
| Find Projects | `projects_list` | `list_projects` |
| List project fields | `projects_list` | `list_project_fields` |
| List project items | `projects_list` | `list_project_items` |
| Read one project resource | `projects_get` | `get_project`, `get_project_field`, or `get_project_item` |
| Add/update/delete project item | `projects_write` | `add_project_item`, `update_project_item`, or `delete_project_item` |
| Read a PR | `pull_request_read` | `get`, `get_comments`, `get_files`, or related method |
| Update a PR | `update_pull_request` | PR number and changed fields |

Use `projects_write` with `create_project` only when the user explicitly requests a new project. An empty project may still need field and workflow configuration that the MCP server cannot fully create.

## Payload patterns

The examples omit any host-specific namespace.

### Discover projects and fields

```json
{
  "method": "list_projects",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "owner_type": "org",
  "per_page": 50
}
```

After selecting a project by verified title and number:

```json
{
  "method": "list_project_fields",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "owner_type": "org",
  "project_number": 7,
  "per_page": 50
}
```

Retain the returned field types and option names for the current operation only. Refresh them when an update fails because a field or option cannot be resolved.

### Create an issue

Call `issue_write`:

```json
{
  "method": "create",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "title": "Make upload retries observable",
  "body": "## Outcome\n...\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] ...",
  "labels": ["area:api", "type:enhancement"],
  "assignees": ["octocat"],
  "type": "Task"
}
```

Include only fields confirmed to exist. Omit `type`, labels, or assignees when unsupported or unspecified. Search for duplicates before creation.

### Add an issue to a project

Call `projects_write`:

```json
{
  "method": "add_project_item",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "owner_type": "org",
  "project_number": 7,
  "item_type": "issue",
  "item_owner": "octo-org",
  "item_repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 42
}
```

An auto-add workflow can race this call. If the issue is already present, locate the existing item and continue rather than creating a duplicate.

### Update a project field

Prefer name-based resolution when the live schema accepts it. Call `projects_write` once per field:

```json
{
  "method": "update_project_item",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "owner_type": "org",
  "project_number": 7,
  "item_owner": "octo-org",
  "item_repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 42,
  "updated_field": {
    "name": "Status",
    "value": "In Progress"
  }
}
```

This issue locator avoids carrying a stale project item ID. If the connected schema requires IDs instead, obtain them from fresh project reads and use the exact returned value.

Set a supported field value to `null` only when the user requests clearing it.

### Verify project values

Call `projects_list` with `method: "list_project_items"` and request the relevant `field_names`, for example `["Status", "Priority"]`. Without `field_names` or `fields`, the server can return only titles.

Paginate and match the content by repository plus issue number. If the add/update response returned an item ID, `projects_get` with `get_project_item` can verify that exact item.

### Preserve labels during issue updates

1. Read labels with `issue_read` and `method: "get_labels"`.
2. Compute the complete desired label set.
3. Call `issue_write` with `method: "update"` and that set.
4. Re-read labels.

Treat `labels` on an update as replacement-capable. Never send only the new label unless the current schema explicitly guarantees additive behavior.

### Create and attach a sub-issue

Create the child normally, then use the child's numeric issue `id` from the create or `issue_read` response:

```json
{
  "method": "add",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 40,
  "sub_issue_id": 123456789
}
```

Here `issue_number` identifies the parent and `sub_issue_id` is the child's numeric database ID, not its issue number or GraphQL node ID. Use `replace_parent: true` only when intentionally moving a child from another parent.

### Update and close an issue

Call `issue_write` with the full intended body when changing checkboxes:

```json
{
  "method": "update",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 42,
  "body": "...preserved body with evidence-backed checkbox changes..."
}
```

Close only after the completion ritual:

```json
{
  "method": "update",
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 42,
  "state": "closed",
  "state_reason": "completed"
}
```

Re-read both issue state and project status. Do not assume one automatically changed the other.

### Add an implementation or completion note

Call `add_issue_comment`:

```json
{
  "owner": "octo-org",
  "repo": "widgets",
  "issue_number": 42,
  "body": "**Implementation note (2026-07-17):** Chose bounded exponential backoff because ... Validation: `make test`. Remaining: ..."
}
```

Use an absolute date and include links or commit SHAs when available.

## Capability gaps

Use a native issue-dependency mutation only if a dedicated dependency write tool appears in the connected schema. Do not route around a missing MCP capability with direct HTTP, CLI, or GraphQL. Record the blocker in the issue body/comment and available project fields or labels, then disclose that the native relation remains unchanged.

Similarly, do not assume the MCP server can create arbitrary project fields, configure project workflows, or edit draft cards. Scope setup requests to tools actually exposed by the connected server.
